# Founder Interview: 2010 Meetup Experience

**Date**: January 2026
**Context**: Interview to gather insights from personal experience hosting and attending meetups in London circa 2010-2014, to inform platform design.

---

## Background

The founder ran a social anxiety support group in London for approximately four years (2010-2014), growing it to a couple thousand members. They hosted hundreds of meetups across various formats and also attended dozens of events as a participant in other groups. The platform used was Meetup.com.

## Key Insights

### The No-Show Problem

**The biggest frustration was no-shows** - often half of RSVPs wouldn't show up. This was particularly challenging for a social anxiety group where last-minute nerves were common, but the problem wasn't limited to that demographic.

**Tactics tried:**

- Collecting deposits (worked when applicable, but rare)
- Collecting phone numbers to text people near event time
- Giving out personal number and asking people to text if they couldn't make it
- Sending caring check-in messages to chronic no-shows

**Insight**: The founder wished the platform tracked RSVP reliability by person to better predict actual attendance.

### Event Formats That Worked

| Format                                | Stress Level | Why It Worked                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workshops with structured tasks**   | Low-Medium   | Clear what to do, shared vulnerability, ice breakers, eye contact exercises, games |
| **Speaker events**                    | Low          | Passive participation OK, natural before/after chat windows                        |
| **Anchor events (Wednesday pub)**     | Low          | Predictable, same time/place, builds habit                                         |
| **1-2-1 intro coffees**               | Low          | Personal onboarding for nervous newcomers                                          |
| **Activity events (cinema, bowling)** | Low-Medium   | Shared focus reduces social pressure                                               |
| **Day trips**                         | Medium       | Extended time together builds bonds                                                |

| Format                  | Stress Level | Why It Struggled                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed dating**        | High         | Too stressful for anxious people, even hosts found it draining |
| **Unstructured mixers** | High         | No scaffolding for conversation                                |

**Key insight**: Structured activities are an accessibility feature. Events with built-in structure are more welcoming for socially anxious or neurodivergent attendees.

### Finding Speakers

Speakers were easy to find through a symbiotic ecosystem:

- Attend other speaking groups
- Invite speakers from those groups to your group
- Speakers weren't paid but could market themselves/their services
- Mutual benefit: speakers get exposure, group gets content

---

### Community Composition

Out of ~2,000 members:

- **Core regulars**: ~12-24 people (the actual community)
- **Semi-regulars**: Showed up occasionally
- **Sleepers**: Joined but never attended
- **Aspirational no-shows**: "Definitely next time!" (but never came)

The last category was particularly poignant - people who wanted to come but couldn't break through whatever barrier stopped them.

---

### Trust & Safety Issues

**Problem encountered**: A couple of men messaged all women in the group asking them out.

**Action taken**: Banned one person for a few weeks. They never returned. The founder felt conflicted - the person had social anxiety issues and the ban may have made things worse, but it was the right decision to protect other members.

**Insight**: Moderation requires compassion but also firm boundaries. Need graduated enforcement with clear communication.

---

### What Kept the Founder Going for 4 Years

- "It was great" - more friends than ever before
- Personal transformation: booking venues, organizing speakers, hosting workshops, socializing, running admin
- Doing things never imagined possible
- Genuine sense of community - "very important part of my life at the time"
- People thanked them for changing their lives, introducing them to partners

**Outcomes from the group:**

- Several genuine friendships that persist today
- People at founder's wedding
- At least one marriage between members
- People who became housemates
- All organic - romance was never the goal, just creating safe space for connection

---

### Growth Factors

- **Persistence**: Running several meetups every week
- **Genuine mission**: Personal growth AND helping others grow/expand comfort zones
- **Word of mouth**: Quality led to organic referrals
- **Occasional platform boosts**: Meetup.com sometimes surfaced the group
- **Inclusivity**: Welcoming everyone regardless of age or anything else

---

### Discovery & Decision Making (As an Attendee)

What influenced attendance decisions:

- Interest in topic (including "wacky" topics like lucid dreaming)
- Structured activities (helped with social anxiety)
- Who else was attending (interesting/attractive people)
- Whether it seemed cliquey/established (deterrent) vs welcoming to newcomers
- Personal rule: once RSVP'd yes, always show up (self-discipline)

---

### Multi-Day Trips: The One That Got Away

The founder tried but could never get a multi-day trip off the ground. This remains a "what if" - the extended time together could have deepened bonds significantly.

---

## New Features Added to Spec

## Part 2: Follow-up Interview (January 2026)

This section captures answers to the questions from Part 1 that were revisited in a follow-up session.

---

### Community Dynamics & Helper Networks

**Did the core regulars know each other outside events?**
Yes - connections formed outside events, both among core and some non-core members. Mostly event-bound, but not entirely.

**Did regulars step up to help?**
Yes:

- Girlfriend helped regularly
- One long-term helper specifically for social anxiety workshops
- Others helped ad-hoc when needed
- Actively encouraged people to become assistant organizers - saw it as good for them AND the group

**Group culture was explicit:**

- "All are welcome"
- No gossiping about others
- No judgment in group

**On delegation:**

- Had to "let go" despite worries about culture drift or politics
- Wanted hosts with different qualities to step up - different vibes work for different people/events

**Tensions between member types?**

- Anxiety manifests differently - some appear confident/relaxed at events
- No noted tensions on age gaps, etc.
- Possible blind spots (founder is on the spectrum, undiagnosed ADHD) - invited messages but unsure if people reached out with concerns

---

### Attendee Behavior

**Why aspirational no-shows didn't show:**

- Anxiety on the day - struggled to walk in door
- Founder offered to come out and walk in with them
- 1:1 coffee was designed as lowest-stress possible entry point
- Some were dismissive / didn't value organizer's time (unknown real reason behind this)
- Competition: other SA groups in London

**Discovery channels:** Meetup.com (primary), Facebook group, standalone blog/website

**People who struggled to connect:**
Definitely existed. Wished could help more but unsure what would have worked.

**Patterns in who became regulars vs vanished:**

- People unable to relax at all were less likely to return
- Some wanted specific types of meetups - hundreds of groups in London to choose from
- Unless they return, algorithm stops showing the group (discovery decay)
- Did newsletters, but only to those who opted in

---

### Organizer Experience

**Was it draining?**
No - overall transformational. Even admin was learning, not burden. "It was a great time in my life."

**Created documented processes:**

- How to run a social anxiety workshop
- How to book venues
- Menu of exercises to pick from
- Promotion guides

**Imposter syndrome:**
Sometimes felt like a "fake" because appeared confident/relaxed when others were introverted. Other times felt very stressed.

**Growth edge:**
Presenting own talk was a stretch - meaningful milestone.

**Difficult behavior conversations:**
Probably avoided some that should have happened. Can't remember specifics.

**Co-organizer coordination:**
Had co-organizers beyond close helpers. No major friction. Main challenge was letting go - worrying they wouldn't host in same culture. Had to trust them.

---

### Platform Pain Points (Meetup.com)

**What was broken:**

- Tracking actual attendance - especially with face blindness, couldn't accurately identify who came
- Didn't want formal "school register" vibe

**What worked:**

- Surveys feature was good - used and liked it

**Outside platform maintenance:**

- Facebook group, blog, website
- Purpose: alternative discovery channels + hedging against platform risk ("what if it goes away or becomes bad")

---

### Multi-Day Trip

**What blocked it:**

- Only 1 person RSVP'd to the planning meetup
- Expected people to leap on it - possible naivety

**Interest vs silence:**
Mainly silence. Hard to learn from silence - don't know the real barrier.

---

### Facilitation

**Connection outside events:**
Intentionally event-focused (except regulars who became genuine friends).

**Boundaries:**
Personal rule: zero romantic involvement with members. Considered them vulnerable people, respected the power dynamic. Met wife through a different, non-SA group.

**Matchmaking:**
Yes, tried sometimes to connect people with shared interests.

---

### Growth & Scaling

**When did it have momentum?**
Momentum earned through consistency - many meetups, both founders' lives poured in. Meetup.com platform helped with discovery.

**Dynamics change with scale:**
Changed when appointed co-organizers - that was the scaling trigger.

**Segmentation:**

- Small events were important - some members really wanted smaller gatherings
- Marked events as "small" in title, capped RSVPs
- 1:1 coffees as smallest option

**Regulars vs tourists:**
Tried to make sure newcomers felt included without overpowering them with too much attention. Balanced welcome.

---

## New Feature Ideas from Part 2

Based on this follow-up interview:

1. **Organizer Playbook Sharing** - Let organizers create and share documented processes (workshop guides, venue booking tips, exercise menus)
2. **Event Size Indicators** - "Intimate (under 10)", "Small (10-20)" with filters in discovery
3. **Anonymous Feedback** - But tension with no-gossip culture; needs careful framing
4. **Templates/Scripts for Difficult Conversations** - For hosts and potentially attendees
5. **Easy Data Export** - Member lists, event history; reduce platform lock-in fear
6. **Interest Polls** - Before high-commitment events to gauge interest without requiring commitment
7. **Expanded Surveys** - Beyond post-event feedback; for interest gathering, member polling

## Previously Unanswered Questions (Now Answered)

Questions 1-20 from Part 1 have been addressed above, with the following notes:

- Q4 (explicit inclusivity signals) - answered implicitly through culture description
- Patterns in who became regulars - partially answered (relaxation, type fit, algorithm decay)

---

## Memorable Quotes

> "It was great. I had more friends than I ever had before. I was doing things I had never done or thought I would - booking venues, organizing speakers, hosting my own workshops, socializing, doing the admin of running a group, taking it to a couple thousand members."

> "Yes, sometimes people thanked me for changing their life, or introducing them to someone who became their partner."

> "I felt bad because they had social anxiety issues and I may have made that worse, but it felt like a reasonable decision." (on banning someone for inappropriate messaging)

---

## Personal Note

This interview captures a meaningful period in the founder's life - a time of personal transformation from someone with social anxiety to a community leader who helped hundreds of people expand their comfort zones and build genuine connections. The platform being designed is, in many ways, an attempt to make it easier for others to create this kind of impact.
