# Founder Interview: 2010 Meetup Experience

**Date**: January 2026
**Context**: Interview to gather insights from personal experience hosting and attending meetups in London circa 2010-2014, to inform platform design.

---

## Background

The founder ran a social anxiety support group in London for approximately four years (2010-2014), growing it to a couple thousand members. They hosted hundreds of meetups across various formats and also attended dozens of events as a participant in other groups. The platform used was Meetup.com.

## Key Insights

### The No-Show Problem

**The biggest frustration was no-shows** - often half of RSVPs wouldn't show up. This was particularly challenging for a social anxiety group where last-minute nerves were common, but the problem wasn't limited to that demographic.

**Tactics tried:**
- Collecting deposits (worked when applicable, but rare)
- Collecting phone numbers to text people near event time
- Giving out personal number and asking people to text if they couldn't make it
- Sending caring check-in messages to chronic no-shows

**Insight**: The founder wished the platform tracked RSVP reliability by person to better predict actual attendance.

### Event Formats That Worked

| Format | Stress Level | Why It Worked |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Workshops with structured tasks** | Low-Medium | Clear what to do, shared vulnerability, ice breakers, eye contact exercises, games |
| **Speaker events** | Low | Passive participation OK, natural before/after chat windows |
| **Anchor events (Wednesday pub)** | Low | Predictable, same time/place, builds habit |
| **1-2-1 intro coffees** | Low | Personal onboarding for nervous newcomers |
| **Activity events (cinema, bowling)** | Low-Medium | Shared focus reduces social pressure |
| **Day trips** | Medium | Extended time together builds bonds |

| Format | Stress Level | Why It Struggled |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Speed dating** | High | Too stressful for anxious people, even hosts found it draining |
| **Unstructured mixers** | High | No scaffolding for conversation |

**Key insight**: Structured activities are an accessibility feature. Events with built-in structure are more welcoming for socially anxious or neurodivergent attendees.

### Finding Speakers

Speakers were easy to find through a symbiotic ecosystem:
- Attend other speaking groups
- Invite speakers from those groups to your group
- Speakers weren't paid but could market themselves/their services
- Mutual benefit: speakers get exposure, group gets content

---

### Community Composition

Out of ~2,000 members:
- **Core regulars**: ~12-24 people (the actual community)
- **Semi-regulars**: Showed up occasionally
- **Sleepers**: Joined but never attended
- **Aspirational no-shows**: "Definitely next time!" (but never came)

The last category was particularly poignant - people who wanted to come but couldn't break through whatever barrier stopped them.

---

### Trust & Safety Issues

**Problem encountered**: A couple of men messaged all women in the group asking them out.

**Action taken**: Banned one person for a few weeks. They never returned. The founder felt conflicted - the person had social anxiety issues and the ban may have made things worse, but it was the right decision to protect other members.

**Insight**: Moderation requires compassion but also firm boundaries. Need graduated enforcement with clear communication.

### What Kept the Founder Going for 4 Years

- "It was great" - more friends than ever before
- Personal transformation: booking venues, organizing speakers, hosting workshops, socializing, running admin
- Doing things never imagined possible
- Genuine sense of community - "very important part of my life at the time"
- People thanked them for changing their lives, introducing them to partners

**Outcomes from the group:**
- Several genuine friendships that persist today
- People at founder's wedding
- At least one marriage between members
- People who became housemates
- All organic - romance was never the goal, just creating safe space for connection

---

### Growth Factors

- **Persistence**: Running several meetups every week
- **Genuine mission**: Personal growth AND helping others grow/expand comfort zones
- **Word of mouth**: Quality led to organic referrals
- **Occasional platform boosts**: Meetup.com sometimes surfaced the group
- **Inclusivity**: Welcoming everyone regardless of age or anything else

---

### Discovery & Decision Making (As an Attendee)

What influenced attendance decisions:
- Interest in topic (including "wacky" topics like lucid dreaming)
- Structured activities (helped with social anxiety)
- Who else was attending (interesting/attractive people)
- Whether it seemed cliquey/established (deterrent) vs welcoming to newcomers
- Personal rule: once RSVP'd yes, always show up (self-discipline)

---

### Multi-Day Trips: The One That Got Away

The founder tried but could never get a multi-day trip off the ground. This remains a "what if" - the extended time together could have deepened bonds significantly.

## Unanswered Questions to Revisit

The following questions were asked but not fully explored. Consider revisiting in a future interview:

### On Community Dynamics
1. Did the core dozen regulars know each other outside of events? Did the group spawn independent friendships?
2. Did any regulars step up to help run things, or was it all on the founder?
3. Were there ever tensions between different "types" of members (age gaps, different severity of anxiety)?
4. Did you do anything explicit to signal inclusivity, or was it just the vibe you set?

### On Attendee Behavior
5. For the "aspirational no-shows" and sleepers - did anyone ever tell you *why* they kept not showing up?
6. Did you notice patterns in who became "regulars" vs who came once and vanished?
7. Were there people who clearly wanted to connect but struggled? Anything you wished you could do to help them?

### On Organizer Experience
8. What were the most time-consuming or draining parts of organizing?
9. Did you have co-organizers? Did that help or create its own problems?
10. Did you ever have to have awkward conversations with attendees about behavior (not banning, but smaller stuff - someone dominating conversation, being off-putting)?

### On Platform Pain Points
11. What was most broken or frustrating about Meetup.com specifically from an organizer's perspective?
12. Did you have to maintain anything outside the platform? (Facebook group, email list, WhatsApp, spreadsheets)

### On the Multi-Day Trip
13. What blocked the multi-day trip from happening? Cost? Logistics? People nervous about that level of intimacy?
14. Did people express interest but not convert, or was there just silence?

### On Facilitation
15. Did you ever think about features that would help people connect *outside* of events? (Or did you intentionally keep it event-focused?)
16. Did you ever play matchmaker? ("You two should talk, you're both into X")

### On Growth & Scaling
17. At what point did the group feel like it had "momentum" and grew itself?
18. Did the group dynamics change as it scaled? Did it get harder to maintain intimacy?
19. Did you segment into sub-groups or smaller events?
20. Were there "regulars" vs "tourists" - and did you treat them differently?

## Memorable Quotes

> "It was great. I had more friends than I ever had before. I was doing things I had never done or thought I would - booking venues, organizing speakers, hosting my own workshops, socializing, doing the admin of running a group, taking it to a couple thousand members."

> "Yes, sometimes people thanked me for changing their life, or introducing them to someone who became their partner."

> "I felt bad because they had social anxiety issues and I may have made that worse, but it felt like a reasonable decision." (on banning someone for inappropriate messaging)

## Personal Note

This interview captures a meaningful period in the founder's life - a time of personal transformation from someone with social anxiety to a community leader who helped hundreds of people expand their comfort zones and build genuine connections. The platform being designed is, in many ways, an attempt to make it easier for others to create this kind of impact.
