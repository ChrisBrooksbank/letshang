## Analysis: Choosing the Right Platform

_A conversational guide to navigating the community platform landscape_

### The Old Guard: Meetup's Complicated Legacy

Twenty-three years after Scott Heiferman founded Meetup in the wake of September 11th, the platform remains the most recognized name in local community building. There's something poetic about its origin story—a New Yorker finally meeting his neighbors after tragedy struck, realizing that technology could facilitate the human connections that modern life had eroded.

But Meetup's story since then has been turbulent. Acquired by WeWork in 2017 for $156 million at the height of that company's hubris, then sold at a loss in 2020, and finally picked up by Italian software company Bending Spoons in 2024. Each ownership change brought uncertainty, and organizers—the lifeblood of the platform—have felt the whiplash.

The platform still works. Sixty million users, 300,000 groups, genuine local discovery. If you're starting a hiking club or a book group and want strangers to find you, Meetup remains the default choice. But at $55+ per month for organizers, it's asking a lot from people who are essentially doing unpaid community labor. The new "Meetup Starter" free tier is a tacit admission that the pricing model needed rethinking.

**Best for:** Established interest-based groups that need local discovery and are willing to pay for it. Running clubs, professional networking, hobby groups.

**Skip if:** You're budget-conscious, want rich online community features, or need more than basic event management.

### The Behemoth: Facebook Groups' Quiet Dominance

Here's a number that should make every other platform nervous: 1.8 billion monthly users in Facebook Groups. That's not a typo. Nearly a quarter of humanity participates in Facebook Groups each month.

The conventional wisdom is that Facebook is dying, that young people have fled to TikTok and Discord. And yet—72% of active Facebook users engage with Marketplace and interest-based Groups. The platform has quietly become essential infrastructure for local communities, parent groups, neighborhood watch, buy-nothing networks, and countless niche interests.

The engagement numbers are remarkable. Private groups generate 40% higher engagement than public ones. Community groups drive 50% more engagement than branded pages. The average user belongs to 8.5 groups. Facebook may not be cool, but it's _useful_ in ways that matter to ordinary people organizing ordinary life.

The downsides are well-documented: algorithmic opacity, Meta's reputation baggage, limited customization, and the nagging sense that you're building on rented land. But if reach matters more than brand control, nothing else comes close.

**Best for:** Anyone who needs maximum reach with zero budget. Local communities, parents, neighborhoods, cause-based organizing.

**Skip if:** You need brand control, want to monetize your community, or your audience actively avoids Facebook.

### The Gamer's Gift: Discord's Unlikely Expansion

Discord wasn't supposed to become a general-purpose community platform. It was built for gamers coordinating raids, and its interface still reflects those origins—servers, channels, roles, bots. The learning curve is real.

But something interesting happened. The same features that made Discord great for gaming—real-time voice chat, granular permissions, extensibility through bots—turned out to be exactly what other communities needed. Now Discord hosts everything from study groups to professional communities to the 21-million-member Midjourney server.

The September 2025 update pushing server capacity to 25 million members is a technical flex, but it signals Discord's ambitions. They're not just tolerating non-gaming communities; they're building for them.

The platform is genuinely free in a way that matters. No feature gates, no "upgrade to unlock" prompts, no sudden pricing changes. Discord makes money from Nitro subscriptions (cosmetic perks) and server boosts, but the core functionality costs nothing.

The demographics tell a story: 70% under 34, 41% aged 18-24. If your community skews young and tech-comfortable, Discord is probably where they already are. If you're targeting professionals over 40, the interface will feel alienating.

**Best for:** Real-time communities, gaming-adjacent interests, tech-savvy audiences, anyone who needs voice chat, young demographics.

**Skip if:** Your audience isn't tech-comfortable, you need event ticketing, or you want public discoverability.

### The Professional's Choice: Eventbrite's Reliable Machinery

Eventbrite is boring in the best way. It's not trying to be a community platform or a social network. It's trying to help you sell tickets, manage attendees, and get paid. And at that narrow mission, it excels.

Ninety-two million monthly active users. Powerful search engine visibility. Integrations with everything. AI-powered recommendations that actually surface relevant events. The 2025 rebrand shows a company confident in its position but not complacent.

The "boring" part is also the limitation. Eventbrite doesn't help you build community between events. It doesn't foster ongoing relationships. It's transactional by design. You create an event, people buy tickets, you deliver the event, everyone goes home. For many use cases, that's exactly right. For others, it leaves a crucial gap.

**Best for:** Ticketed events, conferences, workshops, professional gatherings, anyone who needs reliable payment processing.

**Skip if:** You want ongoing community engagement, you're running free casual events, or you need rich attendee interaction features.

### The Global Messenger: Telegram's Power and Complexity

Telegram is an outlier in this list. It's fundamentally a messaging app, not an event or community platform. But with 1 billion+ users, groups up to 200,000 members, and 10 million active bots, it's become infrastructure for certain types of communities.

The platform dominates specific niches: crypto, international diaspora communities, news distribution, privacy-focused groups. Seventy percent of channel admins monetize through ads or selling products. The bot ecosystem enables automation that other platforms can't match.

But Telegram carries baggage. Its privacy features and lax moderation have made it a haven for bad actors alongside legitimate communities. The user base skews male (57%) and international (strongest in Asia, Europe, and Latin America). Americans often find it unfamiliar.

**Best for:** International communities, crypto/Web3, news distribution, privacy-focused groups, automated community management.

**Skip if:** You need event features, want a mainstream U.S. audience, or are concerned about platform reputation.

### The Internet's Town Square: Reddit's Persistent Relevance

Reddit turned 20 in 2025, and somehow it's more relevant than ever. One hundred sixteen million daily active users. 2.8 million subreddits. And critically for organic growth: Reddit posts show up in Google searches constantly.

The platform defies easy categorization. It's not quite social media—most interactions are pseudonymous. It's not quite a forum—the voting system creates dynamic content curation. It's not quite a community platform—subreddits can feel more like audiences than communities.

But for niche interests, Reddit is often where the most knowledgeable people gather. The specialist subreddits—mechanical keyboards, personal finance, specific video games, obscure hobbies—represent concentrated expertise you can't find elsewhere.

The limitations are real: no event features, not designed for local meetups, inconsistent moderation, and an anonymous culture that can turn toxic. But as a discovery and engagement mechanism for enthusiast communities, nothing matches it.

**Best for:** Niche interest communities, organic discovery through search, discussions that benefit from upvote curation, pseudonymous participation.

**Skip if:** You need event management, want real-time chat, need verified identities, or are building a local community.

### The Creator Economy's Darlings: Circle and Mighty Networks

Circle and Mighty Networks represent a specific bet: that creators can build businesses around community, and that they'll pay premium prices for the right tools.

Circle, founded in 2020, has grown to 18,000+ communities by combining discussion spaces, courses, events, and payments into one platform. The 2025 addition of AI agents—always-on bots trained on your content to engage members—is genuinely innovative. The gamification features (points, levels, leaderboards) drive engagement in ways that feel native rather than bolted-on.

Mighty Networks, slightly older, has facilitated $500+ million in creator earnings. Their white-label mobile apps let creators present their community as a standalone product, not a feature of someone else's platform. The statistic that 84% of content comes from members rather than hosts suggests they've cracked something about peer-to-peer engagement.

Both platforms are expensive by consumer standards—Circle starts at $89/month, Mighty at $41/month, plus transaction fees on sales. Both lack public discoverability; you're not going to attract strangers the way you would on Meetup or Reddit. They're tools for creators who already have audiences and want to deepen those relationships.

**Best for:** Course creators, coaches, membership businesses, anyone monetizing community directly.

**Skip if:** You're budget-conscious, need public discovery, or don't have an existing audience to bring.

### The Party Startup: Partiful's Delightful Simplicity

Partiful's rise feels inevitable in retrospect. The founders, ex-Palantir engineers, looked at Evite and Facebook Events and asked: why does planning a party feel like work?

The result is an app that does one thing beautifully: casual event invitations. Animated templates. Text Blast updates. No account required to RSVP. Payment splitting through Venmo. Shared photo albums after. Everything a 27-year-old needs to organize a birthday party, nothing they don't.

The TIME100 recognition and 400% year-over-year growth validate the thesis. When Apple launched Apple Invites in February 2025, Partiful trolled them on X—the confidence of a startup that knows it's winning its niche.

But the niche is specific. Partiful is for casual social events, not professional gatherings. It's heavily U.S.-focused. There's no ongoing community features; once the party's over, the engagement ends. And with a 25-person team, scaling questions remain.

**Best for:** Casual social events, parties, brunches, game nights—anything informal among friends.

**Skip if:** You need professional event features, ticketing, international reach, or ongoing community engagement.

### The Tech Scene's Favorite: Luma's Quiet Elegance

Luma has become the default choice for a specific demographic: tech workers, startup founders, and creators who care about aesthetics. Its event pages are beautiful in a way that Eventbrite and Meetup simply aren't.

The feature set is thoughtfully curated. Calendar subscriptions let followers track your events. Member management surfaces your most engaged attendees. Zoom integration makes hybrid events seamless. QR check-ins work smoothly. And the pricing is reasonable—free for free events, 5% for paid ones, or $69/month for power users.

But Luma remains a seed-stage company with $3M in funding competing against Eventbrite's public-market resources. The tech scene loves it, but mainstream adoption is limited. For conferences and large-scale events, it lacks the tooling of enterprise platforms.

**Best for:** Tech meetups, creator events, startup launches, anything where design sensibility matters.

**Skip if:** You need enterprise features, mainstream brand recognition, or events outside the tech/creator bubble.

### The Nightlife Disruptor: Posh's TikTok-Style Discovery

Posh represents a different vision of event discovery. Instead of search boxes and filters, you scroll vertically through events like TikTok videos—audiovisual previews that convey the vibe before you commit.

The "Kickback" feature is clever: attendees can share events and earn commissions on resulting ticket sales, turning every guest into a potential promoter. For nightlife events where word-of-mouth drives attendance, this aligns incentives beautifully.

With $22M in Series A funding and 5,000 events monthly, Posh is legitimately scaling. But the focus on intimate gatherings (up to a few hundred people) and nightlife keeps it niche. This isn't where you'll promote your professional conference or nonprofit gala.

**Best for:** Nightlife events, social gatherings, anyone targeting young urban audiences who respond to visual-first discovery.

**Skip if:** You need professional positioning, large-scale events, or audiences outside major U.S. cities.

### The Incumbents: Evite and Paperless Post's Divided Market

Evite and Paperless Post have split the digital invitation market along class lines, and both seem comfortable with the arrangement.

Evite, founded in 1998, owns the casual end: birthday parties, barbecues, book clubs. The free tier is generous (750 guests), the templates are plentiful if uninspired, and everyone over 30 has received an Evite at some point. The excessive ads in the free version are annoying but tolerable for casual use.

Paperless Post, launched in 2009, went upmarket. Designer collaborations with Oscar de la Renta and Rifle Paper Co. Elegant envelope animations that mimic physical stationery. A coin-based pricing system that's confusing but signals "premium." When you receive a Paperless Post, you know the host cares about aesthetics.

Neither platform has evolved much beyond invitations. They don't help with ongoing community engagement or repeat event management. They're point solutions for single events, and they do that well.

**Best for:** Evite for casual personal events; Paperless Post for weddings, galas, and anything requiring elegance.

**Skip if:** You need ongoing community features, event discovery, or anything beyond one-time invitations.

### The Infrastructure Giant: WhatsApp's Untapped Potential

WhatsApp Communities, launched in 2022, represents Meta's acknowledgment that group messaging has become community infrastructure for billions of people. The ability to organize 21 groups under one community umbrella, reaching up to 21,500 people, is substantial.

But WhatsApp wasn't designed for community building and it shows. No event management. No public discovery. Limited moderation tools. No analytics. The average group has just 27 participants—most people use it for family and friends, not communities.

Yet WhatsApp dominates in markets that U.S. tech often ignores. It leads in 65 of the 100 most populous countries. For international communities, diaspora groups, and global organizations, WhatsApp is where people already are.

**Best for:** International communities, groups where members already use WhatsApp, simple coordination that doesn't need formal event tools.

**Skip if:** You need event management, public discovery, detailed analytics, or strong moderation tools.

### The Enterprise Play: Splash and the Corporate Events Market

Splash exists in a different world from Partiful or Meetup. Its customers are marketing teams at companies with event budgets, not individuals planning birthday parties.

The platform's strengths—branded event pages, marketing automation, CRM integration, detailed analytics—serve that market well. A company hosting quarterly customer events or an annual conference needs different tools than a hiking club.

For most readers of this document, Splash is probably overkill. But if you're evaluating platforms for corporate use and have budget to match, it belongs on the shortlist alongside Bizzabo, Cvent, and similar enterprise solutions.

**Best for:** Corporate marketing events, conferences, trade shows, any organization with a dedicated events team and budget.

**Skip if:** You're an individual, small organization, or running casual community events.

### The Cautionary Tale: IRL's Spectacular Collapse

Every landscape analysis should include a failure, and IRL's is instructive.

IRL raised $200 million, achieved unicorn status, and claimed 20 million users. Then in June 2023, an internal investigation revealed that 95% of those users were bots. The company shut down immediately.

In August 2025, founder Abraham Shafi was indicted for wire fraud, securities fraud, and obstruction. Prosecutors allege he spent investor money on luxury hotels and his wedding while concealing the company's actual state.

The lesson isn't just "don't commit fraud." It's that community metrics are easily gamed, and investors should be skeptical of hockey-stick growth in platforms that haven't cracked organic engagement. Genuine community building is slow. Platforms that claim otherwise deserve scrutiny.

### Conclusions: The Fragmented Future

The community platform market in 2025 is more fragmented than ever, and that fragmentation probably serves users well. Different communities have genuinely different needs:

- **For local in-person events with organic discovery:** Meetup remains the default, despite its flaws.
- **For maximum reach at zero cost:** Facebook Groups' scale is unmatched.
- **For real-time engaged community:** Discord has won the tech-savvy segment.
- **For professional ticketed events:** Eventbrite's machinery works.
- **For creator monetization:** Circle and Mighty Networks serve that niche specifically.
- **For casual social events:** Partiful has captured the young professional market.
- **For design-forward tech events:** Luma is the clear choice.

No platform does everything well. The question isn't "which platform is best?" but "which platform best serves _this_ community's specific needs?" The answer varies, and probably should.
